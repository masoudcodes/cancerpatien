The project was intended to be a web application for scheduling appointments. 
The Booking System is used in a medical setting, notably in cancer centres, where it serves as a communication link between the patient and the doctor.
The project helps small- and medium-sized health institutions acquire a productive reservation system.
The development team initially decided to expand into the health sector with a number of initiatives being suggested.
The team decided on a Web-Based Health Appointment Booking System for cancer centres after further internal discussion and consultation with the team's supervisor.
In order to bridge the gap between efficiency and prompt access to healthcare, appointment booking systems are essential to health systems (Gupta, 2008).
